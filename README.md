## Description

This is a website that shows your current or local weather forecast
so you can plan around the weather! To use this weather tracker, the user must input their city into the search box and click search. It will then display your current weather and forecast for the next 5 days, and also create a button for that city to be able to revisit searched cities. The user can add as many cities to the weather dashboard as they can search!
